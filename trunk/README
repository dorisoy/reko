decompiler - a general purpose decompiler.

Decompiler is a C# project containing a decompiler for machine code
binaries.  This project is freely available under the GNU General
Public License.

The project consists of front ends, core decompiler engine, and back
ends to help it achieve its goals.  A command-line, a Windows GUI,
and a ASP.NET front end exist at the time of writing.  The decompiler
engine receives inputs from the front ends in the form of either
individual executable files or decompiler project files. Decompiler
project files contain additional information about a binary file,
helpful to the decompilation process or for formatting the output.
The decompiler engine then proceeds to analyze the source code.

Please note that many software licenses prohibit decompilation or
other reverse engineering of their machine code binaries. Use this
decompiler only if you have legal rights to decompiler the binary
(for instance if the binary is your own.) 

== Version 0.4.1.0 ==
* (Crude) support for loading 32- and 64-bit PowerPC ELF binaries
* Many PowerPC opcodes supported.
* User interface bugfixes (broken keyboard accelerators etc)
* The Copy command (Ctrl+C) is supported in windows where it 
  makes sense. 
== Version 0.4.0.0 ==
* Support added for loading packed binaries using unpacker scripts
  written in OdbgScript.
* Modest beginning of an X86 emulator added to the solution
* New memory navigation bar assists in overview of binary image
* More x86 opcodes supported.
* Many bugs fixed.

Special thanks to halsten, who assisted in the implementation and 
testing of the OdbgScript loader.
