The current version of decompiler is quite crude and could use assistance.

* Support for other processor architectures and platforms. Currently the decompiler 
  is targeted mostly at x86 MS-DOS and Win32 binaries. Support for other
  processors (Motorola 68K, PDP-11, &c) and environments (MacOS, Windows 3.x, OS/2 &c)
  is desired.

* GUI: the work on a useful GUI hasn't left the planning stages; ideas about
  mouse/keyboard interaction to afford a convenient user interface are still mulled.

* Porting to other environments: a Mono/GTK# port is in the works.
